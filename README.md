# Resume Analyzer Model
### Summary: 
Recruiters, especially those at big tech companies, often need to sift through thousands of resumes to identify suitable candidates. Consequently, developing tools to assist in this process is a natural progression. This project leverages NLP-related libraries in Python - such as Gensim, NLTK, spaCy, and RegEx - and data manipulation to create tools designed to support the hiring process.

### Dataset:
A collection of 2400+ Resume Examples taken from livecareer.com for categorizing a given resume into any of the labels defined in the dataset: Resume Dataset.

### Next Steps: 
Implement this model trained on a Portuguese dataset.
